# Pet Project

### Building a MRIgpt from scratch

The purpose of this project is to train a language model that can be tailored to MRI applications based on open-source GPT2 transformer model released by OpenAI. Hopefully this model can be smarter than the original model in answering MRI-related questions.

Follow the great [guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8pRSuU81PU&t=230s) by Andrej Karpathy. 

The architecture of the transformers is slightly modified from the original transformer paper (shown below)
