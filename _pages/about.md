I am now doing post-doctorate research at University of Michigan, ECE department and I am co-advised by [Prof. Jeffrey Fessler](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~fessler/) and [Prof. Douglas Noll](https://nollresearch.engin.umich.edu/). My main research interests include signal and image processing, computational imaging, inverse problems, and machine learning, with a focus on the MRI.  
I have been working on developing algorithms for novel silent MRI techniques, including **model-based and learning-based image reconstruction**, 
**k-space sampling optimization**, **dynamic  image reconstruction**, 
**RF optimization**, and **pulse sequence design**. 
In my past project, I used  **deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**  to predict SPECT/CT scatter by levering the historical and simulation data. 
In addition to my research, I was the graduate student instructor for graduate-level courses 
including **Probability and Random Process**, **Matrix Methods** for Signal Processing, Data Analysis and Machine Learning, and **Medical Imaging Systems** at University of Michigan.
